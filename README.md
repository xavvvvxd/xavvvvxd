Hey there!
I'm xavvvv, a hobbyist software dev from Wales who has a habit of aiming high and hitting low.

I enjoy things that other humans enjoy, such as Minecraft modding, Animal Crossing: GameCube and travelling to distant planets in my spaceship :)

I like to start a lot of projects, however I unfortunately rarely finish them...

I appreciate PRs on any of my repos. In fact, I'll go out of my way to thank you if you submit a PR.

Though I have themed my README around Linux, I actually use Windows for day to day and programming. There's a couple occasions where I use Linux,
but other than that I like to stray away from it.

No, I don't care that you use Arch. Why would I?

I suppose I'll just leave an empty space here for my future achievements...

- null (or None for you Pythonistas)
- null
- null
- null

Oh, also! I'll be pretty impressed if you get the reference from the MOTD (and the hostname). It's from one of my favourite novels :)
I was originally going to name this machine "aincrad", y'know, after the virtual world from Sword Art Online. Then I realized I've never watched Sword Art Online.
Now I need to watch Sword Art Online...

I've rambled quite a bit in this introduction. Hope you didn't mind. Although, I doubt anyone will actually read this to the end. If you have, thanks!
You inspire me to continue what I do :)

...that's a lie. I do this for my own selfish gain >:)

Anyways, this is getting too long. I'm now going to say bye in as many languages as possible. This will be updated.

Bye!
Da bo!
Doei!
Sayonara!
Tschüss!
Au revoir!
Paçim!
